# IMBCR
Welcome to the landing page for the alpha release of the PLJV partnership's work on IMBCR. This is intended to be a resource for biologists and analysts interested in model fitting and other analyses with IMBCR data. This codebase is immature and under some very active development. If you are interested in getting your hands dirty with 'R' and biometrics, dive-in. Report bugs through the issues tracker.
# Installation
```R
library('devtools')
install_github('PLJV/OpenIMBCR')
```
